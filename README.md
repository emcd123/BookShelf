HomeChef
========

HomeChef is a web app for tracking your home cooking recipes.
It will also track how often you've made particular dishes and will allow you to leave notes 
remarking on your success levels or opinion of that recipe.

It will also handle inventory management such as the ocntents of your fridge/pantry and will allow
you to search for recipes you've added containing specific ingredients.

Eventually you will be able to perform weekly meal prep routines and have it organise your shopping list dynamically 
from these routines.
